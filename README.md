## Talking about personal Stuff:

- When I'm not coding or learning, I'm most probably playing French Scrabble :brain: (I made my way into the top 1% of the world ranking :top: in just 3 years of competition). I watch comedies and dramas from time to time.
- I spend most of my free time with my family :family_man_man_girl_boy:. My loved ones are very special to me. :hearts:
- I love to travel and would like to be a digital nomad for a while in the near future.
